# Big Data: from Data to Decisions

This is my personal repository from the online course on futurelearn.com. Everything is running on
a Cloudera Virtual Machine, which has been downloaded from [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms.html) .

Code is taken from the example exercises and copied into my personal directory for later reference.
The original code has been cloned from [github](https://github.com/QUT-BDA-MOOC/FLbigdataD2D).

Any datasets to be used have to be copied first into the hadoop filesystem (hadoop fs -put)
Results are also written back into HDFS.
